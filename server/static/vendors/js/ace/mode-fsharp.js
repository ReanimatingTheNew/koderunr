  //  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   //
  //  1. Definitions.
   //
  //     "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

  //     direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
  //     otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

  //     source, and configuration files.
   //
  //     "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
  //     transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
  //     not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
  //     and conversions to other media types.
   //
  //     "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
  //     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
  //     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
  //     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
   //
  //     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
  //     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
  //     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
  //     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
  //     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
  //     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
  //     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
   //
  //     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
  //     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
  //     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
  //     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
  //     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
  //     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
  //     means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
  //     to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
  //     communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
  //     and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
  //     Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
  //     excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
  //     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   //
  //     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
  //     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
  //     subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   //
  //  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  //     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  //     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  //     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
  //     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
  //     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   //
  //  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
  //     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
  //     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
  //     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
  //     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
  //     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
  //     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
  //     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
  //     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
  //     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
  //     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
  //     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
  //     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
  //     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
  //     as of the date such litigation is filed.
   //
  //  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  //     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
  //     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
  //     meet the following conditions:
   //
  //     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
  //         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   //
  //     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
  //         stating that You changed the files; and
   //
  //     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
  //         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
  //         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
  //         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
  //         the Derivative Works; and
   //
  //     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
  //         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
  //         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
  //         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
  //         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
  //         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
  //         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
  //         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
  //         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
  //         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
  //         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
  //         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
  //         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
  //         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
  //         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
  //         as modifying the License.
   //
  //     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  //     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
  //     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
  //     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
  //     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
  //     the conditions stated in this License.
   //
  //  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  //     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
  //     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
  //     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
  //     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
  //     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
  //     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   //
  //  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
  //     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
  //     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
  //     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   //
  //  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
  //     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
  //     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
  //     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
  //     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
  //     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
  //     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  //     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  //     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   //
  //  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
  //     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  //     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  //     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  //     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  //     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  //     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  //     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  //     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  //     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  //     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   //
  //  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
  //     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
  //     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
  //     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
  //     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
  //     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
  //     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
  //     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  //     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
  //     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   //
  //  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   //
  //  APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
   //
  //     To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
  //     boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
  //     replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

  //     comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
  //     file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
  //     same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
  //     identification within third-party archives.
